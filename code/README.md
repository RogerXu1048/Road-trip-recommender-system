We used Python 3.11 for this assignment.

See details for the decision tree in DT.py. The data used for training the decision tree is raw_data.txt

The generated data are mock_edges.csv and mock_locations.csv under the "datas" directory.

For solution, see sol.py for details.

For definition of graph, edge, vertex, and path, see graph.py for details.

We trained the decision tree in main.py.

See test results in test1.txt, test2.txt, test3.txt. 
Note: The utility score sometimes does not change because the road is cycling in a part of the graph. Thus, the themes encountered do not increase so the decision tree outputs the same utility score for these roads.

Reflection on the use of AI: we didn't use AI to help our programming for this assignment.

All our test cases had possible solutions. All solutions met the hard time constraints.
